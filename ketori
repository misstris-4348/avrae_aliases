-desc "A brief history of the half-orc child known as Ketori Siannodel-Ravenwood"
-f "Ketori Siannodel-Ravenwood is a half-orc preteen (currently 13 years of age) who resides in Mossfort with her mother's Gaelin Siannodel and Anya Ravenwood. Ketori was adopted by her parents over a year ago from Father Whisker's establishment in Nephix."
-f "History| Ketori's early childhood was traumatic having watched her orcish mother strangle her human father. She was then taken in by Father Whiskers, who she spend a vast majority of her childhood."
-f "Personality| Ketori having grown up surrounded by children mostly younger than her has a bit of a big sister complex, which is tempered by her sarcasm and snarkiness. She has what some might call an attitude problem, but generally has a good heart. She loves all creatures, and generally spends her time with her family's various pets, familiars, and mounts."
-f "Weapons| Ketori due to her orcish heritage, prefers the larger weapons like battleaxes, handaxes, and her boxing gloves."
-f "Other relationships| Ketori is close with many of the other children who resided at Father Whisker's with her. She sees Kiala, Juniper, and Thessa as her closest friends, viewing them more like sisters. She has a love-hate sibling relationship with Kent, teasing him mercilessly, but out for blood with any other person that tries to do him harm of any kind. Adults she is close to are all friends of her mother's or the adoptive parents of her orphan siblings. Her exetended family is as follows- Aunt Adrienne, Uncle Pete, Uncle Kles, Uncle Lord Buster, Aunt Didi, Uncle Egnaro, Miss Mara, and Uncle Boxi.
